                    Arjun, having solved the  bank robbery (click to read) , felt very proud and ready for new challenges. He loved spending time with his girlfriend, whose identity he kept secret to protect her. One night, Arjun received a call from the police chief.
                    
                    "Hello, Arjun," said the chief. 
                    
                    "Yes, chief. Any new case?" Arjun replied.
                    
                    "Yeah, need your help, man. Come to the Nightlight Party Club."
                    
                    "Okay," Arjun responded.
                    
                    
                    
                    Curious, Arjun got on his bike and headed towards the Nightlight Party Club. The streets leading to the club looked spooky and eerie. When he arrived, he met the chief at a crime scene in front of the club, where there was a dead body.
                    
                    
                    
                    "Hey man, come on. This case is unpredictable," said the chief.
                    
                    "Don't worry, chief. Detective Arjun is on the case. What happened here?" Arjun asked.
                    
                    "There was a car accident, and we found a dead body with a burnt face. It's making the case very tough," the chief explained.
                    
                    "Identifying the face will help us to proceed  the case," Arjun stated.
                    
                    Suddenly, a voice called out, "Sir, it's my friend." The voice belonged to a boy named Sandy, who looked very sad and innocent.
                    
                     
                    
                    Arjun began questioning Sandy. During the investigation, Arjun learned that the victim was a boy named Mani, who had lost his parents when he was young. Sandy and their friends had come to the club to celebrate their college farewell, and Mani had left early because he didn't like the party scene. Sandy identified the dead body as Mani and explained that Mani had borrowed Sandy's car to go home.
                    
                     
                    
                    Forensic experts collected evidence, including a chain with a dollar sign from the dead body, which was given to the police officer for safekeeping. Based on Sandy's statement, the dead boy was Mani, and it seemed to be a car accident.
                    
                     
                    
                    The chief concluded, "It's an accident; the case is over."
                    
                    
                    
                    Arjun saw relief on Sandy's face this made arjun confused as he left the club.
                    
                    The next day, the autopsy report and a detailed analysis of the car revealed that the fire was caused by an overheated battery that ignited leaked fuel. Despite this, Arjun sensed something was wrong.
                    
                    A few days later, Arjun met his friend Ram, a detective from a nearby city. They went to a tea shop to relax.
                    
                     
                    
                    Ram asked, "Do you want a cigarette?"
                    
                    Arjun remembered his girlfriend's words and said, "No man, I quit that habit."
                    
                    With a cigarette in his mouth, Ram began to rant about his current case.
                    
                    "I am just searching for a boy who recently completed college, and I've been searching for him for five days. I'm getting frustrated," Ram said.
                    
                    "Analyze each and every piece of evidence you have," Arjun advised.
                    
                     
                    
                    Ram described the missing boy, and the identification matched Mani's dead body. Arjun took Ram to the police station and showed him the belongings of the dead body.
                    
                     
                    
                    "These belong to Ravi, not Mani," Ram exclaimed.
                    
                     
                    
                    Arjun explained what happened to Ram. Earlier, Arjun had suggested the chief to  keep the body in the mortuary, which allowed for a DNA test of the dead body and Ravi's parents. Arjun also noticed a discrepancy in the autopsy report: the person died at 6:00 PM, but the car accident happened at 8:00 PM. Mani's activities at 7:30 PM further confused Arjun. The DNA test confirmed that the dead boy was Ravi, and the body was handed over to Ravi's parents.
                    
                     
                    
                    Arjun had obtained Sandy's information earlier and went to the address provided, but it was false. Unfazed, he went to the college where Sandy and the unknown man studied. He gathered much information about them, after finishing school, there was a three-year gap before they joined college. This triggered Arjun's curiosity. With the police chief's help, Arjun met their school principal, who revealed that the boys were not good students and had gotten involved with a mafia gang after the 10th standard. Despite the principal's assumption that they might have been captured by the police, there were no records in the police database.
                    
                     
                    
                    Arjun continued his investigation. Days later, he went to the police chief to report his progress and recognized a face he had seen in jail. It was Sandy, who was the suspect Arjun was searching for. Arjun informed the chief, and they devised a plan to use Sandy to catch his partner in a drug deal.
                    
                     
                    
                    The police investigated Sandy on their special way, then he revealed details about his partner and their big drug dealings. Sandyâ€™s bad luck , he had been caught by the police for a minor case and was being used to help capture his partner. The police and Arjun, fully armed, went to the meeting spot with Sandy, posing as clients, while other officers surrounded the area.
                    
                    
                    
                    Upon arrival, they met Sandy's partner, Antony Kannan. The place was filthy and filled with thugs. When the drug van arrived, Sandy suddenly shouted, "These two are police, not clients!"
                    
                    
                    
                    Arjun and the chief were immediately surrounded by the thugs. Anticipating this, Arjun pressed a buzzer to signal the police to storm the area. The police quickly entered with guns, causing the thugs to panic and lose focus.
                    
                    
                    
                    Arjun and the chief took cover, engaging in a gunfight with Antony's gang. The air was thick with tension as bullets flew. Arjun, with his sharp reflexes, took down several thugs while ensuring the chief's safety.  Antony tried to escape, but Arjun's quick thinking and precise shooting him. The police killed the remaining thugs, securing the area. (Antony and Sandy were shot by arjun)
                    
                    
                    
                    Finally, the police arrested the surviving gang members and seized the drug van. The operation was a significant success, making headlines across the city.
                    
                    **Note** Ravi had been killed in front of the club because he overheard Antony and Sandy's conversation. They used his body to cover up their business. Antony , sandy and Ravi are same college.
